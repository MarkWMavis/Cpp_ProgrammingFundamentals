/*
* Arrays are COMPOUND data types or data structure that hold
*	elements of the same type. Each element can be accessed directly.
* 
* It is a data type that must be made up of the same data type.
*	- Ex. a collection of test scores that are ints.
* 
* Characteristics
*	- Fixed size
*	- Elements are all the same type
*	- Stored contiguously in memory
*	- Individual elements can be accessed by their position or index
* 
*	- First element is at index 0
*	- Last element is at index size-1
* 
* Always initialize arrays
* Very Efficient
* Iteration is often used to process
